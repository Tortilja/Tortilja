Welcome to my GitHub.ðŸ‘‹

My name is IÄ¼ja TeÄ¼novs, I am from Latvia, and I am passionate about programming. 
When I was little, I wanted to be an interior designer, but a close friend showed me what programming is about, and in that moment, I wrote my first "Hello world" and realised who I was meant to be.
